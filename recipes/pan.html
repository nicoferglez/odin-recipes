    <h3>Here is delicious whole wheat bread with reduced sodium, baked in a Dutch oven.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon agave nectar</li>
        <li>3 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water into a microwave-safe measuring cup and heat in the microwave oven for about 1 minute. Check temperature using a food thermometer to be sure water is no hotter than 100 degrees F (38 degrees C). Add yeast and agave; let sit until foamy, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture; stir to combine and knead a few times. Cover bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, overnight to 18 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead 5 to 10 times using floured hands. Shape dough into a ball and let rise while oven is preheating.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and place a Dutch oven inside to warm for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use floured hands to carefully drop dough into the hot Dutch oven. Use potholders to place the lid on the Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the hot oven for 30 minutes. Uncover Dutch oven and bake until bread is deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove and let cool.</li>
    </ol>
